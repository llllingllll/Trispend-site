# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-10

Welcome to Trispend (“the App”). This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, how we store/share it, and the choices you have.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Account Info**: Your email and the minimal data returned by sign-in providers (e.g., Apple/Google) to authenticate your account.
- **App Data**: Your locally/cloud-stored trips, expenses, categories, and participants.
- **Diagnostics & Usage**: Crash logs, basic device info (OS version, model), and **optional** de-identified analytics to improve stability and features (analytics can be disabled in Settings).
- **Purchase Info**: In-app purchase/entitlement status (e.g., Pro, expiration date). We do **not** store your credit card number.

> We do not sell your personal data.
> 

## 2. How We Use Information

- Provide and maintain core features (tracking expenses, splitting, analytics).
- Account verification and security (including third-party sign-in).
- Improve performance and stability (crash/usage analytics).
- Process subscriptions/purchases and restore entitlements.
- Legal compliance and abuse prevention.

## 3. Storage & Sync

- **Local (Free users)**: Your data is stored on your device via **SwiftData**.
- **iCloud Sync (Pro feature)**: Upgrading to Pro enables CloudKit sync across your devices.
- **Deletion & Backups**: Deleting local data does not automatically remove copies in your iCloud account. **Final removal of iCloud data must be performed by you at the system level** (see in-app instructions).

> We cannot access your iCloud contents. Sync depends on iCloud availability and network conditions.
> 

## 4. Subscriptions & In-App Purchases

- We use App Store / StoreKit to process purchases and entitlements.
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled **at least 24 hours** before the current period ends.
- Restore Purchases will sync your Pro entitlement across devices.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 1) Google Firebase

We use **Firebase Crashlytics** (crash reporting), **Firebase Authentication** (Google/email sign-in), and optionally **Remote Config / In-App Messaging**.

When you sign up/sign in, **your email (and minimal info from the provider)** is processed by Firebase for authentication. Crash and analytics data are collected in a de-identified or device-level form to improve stability and features. You can disable Analytics in the app (crash reporting may remain for safety/stability).

### 2) Apple (refund-assist data, only if you request a refund)

If you request a **refund** for an in-app purchase made in Trispend, we may share necessary data with Apple about your **access/consumption** of the purchased content (e.g., unlock time, whether it was used) **solely** to help Apple assess the refund request, following Apple policies and the data-minimization principle.

## 6. Your Choices & Rights

- **Marketing Opt-out**: We currently do not send marketing communications; if introduced, we will provide an opt-out.
- **Regional Rights**: We honor privacy rights under applicable laws (e.g., access and deletion).

> iCloud data removal: Please follow the in-app instructions to remove data at the system level.
> 

## 7. Data Retention

- Accounts & trip data: Retained until you delete your account/data or as required by law.
- Purchase records: Retained for statutory tax/accounting periods.
- Refund-related data: Retained only as needed to process the request.

## 8. Children

The App is not directed to children under the age required by law. We do not knowingly collect children’s personal data.

## 9. International Transfers

Your data may be processed in regions with different data-protection laws. We take reasonable measures to protect it.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We’ll notify you in-app or on our site about material changes. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
