# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-17

Welcome to Trispend (“the App”). This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, how we store/share it, and the choices you have.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Account Info**: Your email and the minimal data returned by sign-in providers (e.g., Apple/Google) to authenticate your account.
- **App Data**: Your locally/cloud-stored trips, expenses, categories, and participants.
- **Diagnostics & Usage**: Crash logs via Firebase Crashlytics, basic device info (OS version, model), and **de-identified usage analytics** (e.g., app launches, feature usage) to improve stability and features.
- **Purchase Info**: In-app purchase/entitlement status (e.g., Pro, expiration date). We do **not** store your credit card number.

> Note: Analytics data is collected automatically and cannot be disabled. Crash reporting is essential for app stability. No personally identifiable information is included in analytics events. We do not sell your personal data.


## 2. How We Use Information

- Provide and maintain core features (tracking expenses, splitting, analytics).
- Account verification and security (including third-party sign-in).
- Improve performance and stability (crash/usage analytics).
- Process subscriptions/purchases and restore entitlements.
- Legal compliance and abuse prevention.

## 3. Storage & Sync

- **Local Storage**: Your data is stored on your device via **SwiftData** in a local database.
- **No Cloud Sync**: Currently, the app does NOT sync data via iCloud. All data remains on your device unless you manually back up via device backup.
- **Data Portability**: Pro users can export their data for backup purposes.
- **Deletion**: Deleting the app will remove all local data. Device backups may retain copies depending on your backup settings.

## 4. Subscriptions & In-App Purchases

- We use App Store / StoreKit to process purchases and entitlements.
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled **at least 24 hours** before the current period ends.
- Restore Purchases will sync your Pro entitlement across devices.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 1) Google Firebase

We use Firebase Crashlytics (crash reporting), Firebase Authentication (Google/email sign-in), and optionally Remote Config / In-App Messaging.

When you sign up/sign in, your email (and minimal info from the provider) is processed by Firebase for authentication. Crash and analytics data are collected in a de-identified or device-level form to improve stability and features. **Analytics and crash reporting are collected automatically to ensure app quality and cannot be disabled by users.**

### 2) Apple (refund-assist data, only if you request a refund)

If you request a **refund** for an in-app purchase made in Trispend, we may share necessary data with Apple about your **access/consumption** of the purchased content (e.g., unlock time, whether it was used) **solely** to help Apple assess the refund request, following Apple policies and the data-minimization principle.

## 6. Your Choices & Rights

- **Marketing Opt-out**: We currently do not send marketing communications; if introduced, we will provide an opt-out.
- **Regional Rights**: We honor privacy rights under applicable laws (e.g., access and deletion).

> iCloud data removal: Please follow the in-app instructions to remove data at the system level.

## 7. Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Trip and expense data stored on your device is retained until you delete it via the app or uninstall the app.
- **Account Data**: Firebase Authentication records are retained until you delete your account through the app.
- **Crash Logs**: Firebase Crashlytics retains crash logs for up to 90 days for debugging purposes.
- **Purchase Records**: App Store transaction records are retained by Apple per their policies. We only store entitlement status (Pro/Free) locally.
- **Analytics Data**: De-identified analytics data is retained for up to 14 months by Firebase.

## 8. Children

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us immediately.

## 9. International Transfers

Your data may be processed in regions with different data-protection laws. We take reasonable measures to protect it.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We’ll notify you in-app or on our site about material changes. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
