# Terms of Use — Trispend (iOS)

**Last updated:** 2025-08-11

Welcome to Trispend. By using the app, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. About the Service
Trispend is an expense tracker for trips and everyday travel. It lets you record expenses, view summaries, and (if enabled) collaborate and sync across devices. The Service is provided **as is** and **as available**.

## 2. Eligibility & Account
You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract and agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. You must be at least 13 years old (or the age required in your jurisdiction). Keep your device and sign‑in credentials secure. You are responsible for activity under your account.

## 3. License & Acceptable Use
We grant you a personal, limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the App on Apple devices you own or control. You agree not to: reverse engineer or attempt to access the Service by unauthorized means; interfere with or disrupt the Service; upload unlawful or infringing content; or use the Service to send spam or abusive communications.

## 4. Data, Storage & Sync
By default, expense data is stored on your device. If you upgrade and enable iCloud sync, your data may be stored in your iCloud account via CloudKit. Deleting local data **does not** remove copies in iCloud; final removal must be performed by you at the system level (see in‑app instructions). We cannot access your iCloud content. Availability depends on Apple iCloud and your network connection. Carrier data charges may apply and are your responsibility.

## 5. Purchases, Subscriptions & Trials
We use Apple’s App Store / StoreKit (and, if applicable, RevenueCat) to process purchases and entitlements. Prices may vary by region, taxes, and promotions. **Subscriptions auto‑renew** unless canceled at least **24 hours** before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel in **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**. “Restore Purchases” re‑activates eligible entitlements on your devices. Refunds are handled by Apple under App Store policies.

## 6. Changes to the Service
We may add, change, or discontinue features at any time. We may limit or suspend access if needed for security, legal, or operational reasons.

## 7. User Content & IP
You retain ownership of the expense data and content you input. You grant us a limited license to process that content solely to operate and improve the Service. Trispend, its name, logos, and software are protected by intellectual‑property laws. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

## 8. Third‑Party Services
The Service may integrate with third‑party services (e.g., Apple iCloud, Sign in with Apple/Google, Firebase Authentication/Crashlytics, RevenueCat). Their terms and privacy policies apply to their components.

## 9. Privacy
Our handling of information is described in the Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference.

## 10. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violating these Terms or for misuse of the Service. You may stop using the Service at any time.

## 11. Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE”** WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. YOU USE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

## 13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from third‑party claims arising out of your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law.

## 14. Governing Law & Disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of your place of residence **or** the laws of the jurisdiction where our company is established, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws rules. Venue for disputes will be a competent court in that jurisdiction unless mandatory local law provides otherwise. Arbitration may be used where required or permitted by applicable law.

## 15. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified in‑app or on our site. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
